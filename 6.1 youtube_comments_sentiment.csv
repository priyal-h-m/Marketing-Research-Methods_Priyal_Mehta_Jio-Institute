"Lessons i learnt :- 
1) Do not rush on market if you have already idea how this sector works before lounch make product excellent then jump directly and disrupt the entire market. 

2) If you can't do great things then do simple thing in a great way. 

3) Disrupt < Excellent Disrupt",0.2052,Positive
