If you have anything you'd recommend to add to this guide leave a comment below.\\\\n\\\\n# What does Pax mean? Common terms on this sub explained\\\\n\\\\n**Pax:**\\u00a0Short for Passenger.\\\\n\\\\n**Ping**: The noise the app makes when drivers receive a pickup request.\\\\n\\\\n**Fare**: The fee a rider is charged.\\\\n\\\\n**Fair:**\\u00a0Fare, spelled wrong.\\\\n\\\\n**Surge**: Uber occasionally up-charges riders during times of increased demand. The Surge is a multiplier of the base fare rate.\\\\n\\\\n**SRF:**\\u00a0\\\"Safe Rider Fee\\\", now known as the \\\"Booking Fee\\\". This is the $1-3 fee that Uber adds to every fare to ccover insurance, app fees, etc.\\\\n\\\\n# What are the requirements to be an uber driver?\\\\n\\\\nAn in-state license is required. Have at least one year of licensed driving experience in the US (3 years if you are under 25 years old) Use an eligible 4-door vehicle\\\\n\\\\nAll vehicles being used for rides on the Uber app must meet the following minimum requirements:\\\\n\\\\n* Must have 4 doors and be able to transport a minimum of 4 passengers\\\\n* Vehicle model must be 16years old or newer\\\\n* Title cannot be salvaged, reconstructed, or rebuilt\\\\n* Rental vehicles, except those from an approved Uber rental car partner are not permitted\\\\n* Cannot have any cosmetic damage, missing pieces, or commercial branding\\\\n\\\\nShould you choose to drive a vehicle you do not personally own, you must have permission from then vehicle owner and be listed as an insured driver on the vehicle\\u2019s insurance policy. Please note that Uber cannot allow a vehicle onto the platform if the driver\\u2019s name is not on the insurance document.\\\\n\\\\nIf your vehicle does not match the requirements above, you may still be able to use your vehicle for deliveries on the Uber app.\\\\n\\\\n**Is this fulltime job?**\\\\n\\\\nDriving with Uber offers a flexible earning opportunity. It's a great alternative to full-time driver jobs, part-time driver jobs, or other part-time gigs, temp jobs, or seasonal employment.\\\\n\\\\n**How do I do my first ride?**\\\\n\\\\nDownload and install the driver app, and hit \\\"Go Online\\\". Once you get a request (a \\\"ping\\\"), you can hit 'Navigate' to be taken to the rider's pickup location. When you're sure you have arrived, flip back over to the Uber app and hit 'Arrived'. The passenger (PAX) will be notified of your arrival, though it's also nice to text them - to let them know what type of car you're in (though they see this on their app, not everyone looks) and to confirm that they're actually where their pin was placed. When they get in the car, hit 'Begin Trip'. If they haven't entered their destination, you can enter it - then hit 'Navigate' again and you will be routed there. At the end of the trip, hit 'End Trip', rate your passenger, and you'll be placed back online ready to pick up another PAX!\\\\n\\\\n# What are the safety features for uber drivers?\\\\n\\\\n**Emergency assistance button**\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the in-app Emergency Button to call authorities to get help if you need it. The app displays your location and trip details, so you can quickly share them with emergency services.\\\\n\\\\n**24/7 incident support**\\\\n\\\\nUber customer associates trained in incident response are available around the clock.\\\\n\\\\n**Follow My Ride**\\\\n\\\\nFriends and family can follow your route and will know as soon as you arrive.\\\\n\\\\n**2-way ratings**\\\\n\\\\nYour feedback matters. Low-rated trips are logged, and users may be removed to protect the Uber community.\\\\n\\\\n**Phone anonymization**\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to contact your rider through the app, your phone number may stay private.\\\\n\\\\n**GPS tracking**\\\\n\\\\nAll Uber trips are tracked from start to finish, so there\\u2019s a record of your trip if something happens.\\\\n\\\\n**RideCheck**\\\\n\\\\nUsing sensors and GPS data, RideCheck can help detect if a trip goes unusually off-course or a possible crash has occurred. If the app alerts us to such events, we\\u2019ll check in on you and offer resources to get help.\\\\n\\\\n**Contact Safety Agent**\\\\n\\\\nYou can connect with an ADT Safety Agent via phone call or text on every trip. Just tap the safety shield icon and select Contact safety agent.\\\\n\\\\n**Audio Recording**\\\\n\\\\nIf you feel uncomfortable, you can record the audio of the trip within the app. Just tap the blue shield to open your Safety Toolkit and access the Record Audio option.\\\\n\\\\n**Emergency help if you need it**\\\\n\\\\nIf you ever need urgent help when riding with the Uber app, you can contact 911 using the in-app Emergency Button in the Safety Toolkit.\\\\n\\\\nThe app will show your live location, vehicle information, and license plate number, which you can quickly share with the emergency dispatcher so they can send help faster. And in a growing number of US cities, this information is automatically provided to the dispatcher.\\\\n\\\\n# Does Uber help in event of an accident?\\\\n\\\\nWhen you earn with a transportation network company (TNC), referred to here as ridesharing, many states require extra\\u2014and costly\\u2014insurance.\\\\n\\\\nUber maintains this insurance on your behalf. What\\u2019s covered depends on factors such as who was at fault; whether you were offline, online, en route, or on-trip; and your personal insurance policy.\\\\n\\\\n**Offline coverage:**\\\\n\\\\nYour personal auto insurance covers you while you\\u2019re offline. You must maintain personal automobile insurance at mandatory minimum limits and provide proof of your insurance to drive and deliver with a vehicle with Uber.\\\\n\\\\nCoverage to repair your car when you\\u2019re en route to or on a trip is contingent on your personal insurance including comprehensive and collision coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Coverage when online and available for a trip**\\\\n\\\\nAccidents happen. Suppose you\\u2019re at fault and another person gets hurt or their vehicle gets damaged. In that case, our third-party liability insurance covers the cost of injuries or damage in at least the following amounts:\\\\n\\\\n-$50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident for injuries\\\\n\\\\n-$25,000 in property damage per accident\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the law of your state, Uber may maintain extra coverage for you and your riders, including one or more of the following:\\\\n\\\\nCoverage for you and your riders for injuries in a hit-and-run or an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver\\\\n\\\\nPersonal injury protection, including medical expenses and lost wages for you and your riders, no matter who\\u2019s at fault\\\\n\\\\nMedical payments coverage for you and your riders, no matter who\\u2019s at fault.\\\\n\\\\n**Coverage when en route or on a trip**\\\\n\\\\nUber maintains some of the most comprehensive insurance for ridesharing and deliveries, including:\\\\n\\\\n-Insurance that covers at least $1,000,000 for property damage and injuries to riders and third parties involved in an accident where you\\u2019re at fault\\\\n\\\\nInsurance that covers the cost to repair your car, up to the actual cash value, with a $2,500 deductible, contingent on your personal insurance including comprehensive and collision coverage. This extra insurance maintained by Uber protects your car, no matter who\\u2019s at fault, if you maintain comprehensive and collision coverage on your own vehicle.\\\\n\\\\nIn most US states, you can also purchase Optional Injury Protection to cover your additional medical expenses if you\\u2019re hurt in an accident. This insurance offering, pioneered by Uber, is designed specifically for drivers.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the law of your state, Uber may maintain extra coverage for you and your riders, including one or more of the following:\\\\n\\\\n-Coverage for you and your riders for injuries in a hit-and-run or an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver\\\\n\\\\nPersonal injury protection, including medical expenses and lost wages for you and your riders, no matter who\\u2019s at fault\\\\n\\\\nMedical payments coverage for you and your riders, no matter who\\u2019s at fault\\\\n\\\\n# Is being an uber driver worth it?\\\\n\\\\nRecent reports from Uber state that \\\"the vast majority of drivers are satisfied\\\" and that \\\"as of last quarter, drivers in the US were making about $33 per utilized hour\\\" before expenses.\\\\n\\\\nIts for you to decide if its worth it for you personally, volume and earnings will vary greatly between markets. Drivers as independant contractors are also responsible for all expenses which have been rising fast when drivers pay has stayed stagnant.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many direct and hidden costs associated with being an uber driver. To start with, You are responsible for tracking your own miles, profits and losses, as well as expenses such as gas, repairs, washes, and so on.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, no one but you is responsible for ensuring you are earning enough.
